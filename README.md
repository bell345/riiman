## Rust Intelligent Image Manager

A desktop application designed to make managing images a breeze with an extremely powerful yet intuitive feature set.

Targeting the following workflows:

* Quick tagging of images
* Image lookup based on tags
* Hand-picking images to import
* Conversion on import (compression, upscaling, changing aspect ratio with smart background)

Uses the Rust `egui` project to achieve a cross-platform desktop UI.
